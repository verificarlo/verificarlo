Verificarlo CHANGELOG

# [v0.8.0] 2022/07/01

## Added
  * New interflop_mca_int.so backend. This new MCA backend uses integer computations

  * Add `interflop_call` function into interflop_backend_interface_t interface.
  Allows user to directly call low-level backend functions
  * Add INTERFLOP_CALL_INEXACT allowing to directly perturb one fp value through `interflop_call` mechanism
  * Add test_usercall_inexact to test the INTERFLOP_CALL_INEXACT user call
## Changed
  * VFC_BACKENDS_LOGGER=False behaviour. Now truly disable logger_info output.
  * Redirect logger_info to stdout instead of stderr
